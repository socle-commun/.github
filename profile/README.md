## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **Socle Commun**!
We are an open, community-driven organization building inclusive, accessible, and sustainable digital tools for education, communities, and public interest technology.

Whether you're a developer, designer, educator, or activist—we believe tech should work *with* people, not against them.

* 🌍 **Sustainable** — committed to ethical tech and low-tech-friendly approaches

All our projects are designed to be **readable and maintainable by both humans and AI agents**, following strict conventions to ease automated contributions.
