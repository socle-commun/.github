# Hi there 👋

Welcome to **Socle Commun**!
We’re an open, community-driven organization creating inclusive, accessible, and sustainable digital tools for education, grassroots communities, and public interest tech. Whether you’re a developer, designer, teacher, or activist—we believe tech should work *with* you, not against you.

## 🙋‍♀️ What is Socle Commun?

**Socle Commun** (French for "common foundation") is about shared digital infrastructure for the common good.
Our mission is to provide foundational tools and libraries that are:

* 🌈 **Inclusive** — built for diverse users across languages, cultures, and abilities
* 👥 **Collaborative** — open-source and community-developed
* 🛠️ **Practical** — focused on real-world needs in education, accessibility, and environmental impact
* 🌍 **Sustainable** — committed to ethical tech and low-tech-friendly approaches

## 🔧 Our Projects

* **🌐 Picto** — A modular toolset for creating and managing inclusive pictograms, with multilingual support and adaptable user interfaces.
* **🤖 Sloth** — A set of AI-powered developer tools and libraries designed to *slow down and think better*, helping devs automate tedious tasks while keeping humans in control.
* **📚 Socle Docs** — A documentation hub focused on clear, accessible knowledge-sharing across all projects.
* **🌿 Civic & Gardening Tech** — Open-source kits for urban gardening, educational makerspaces, and more.
